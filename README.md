## **Context**
--------------------

Game of Thrones is a wildly popular television series by HBO, based on the (also) wildly popular book series **"A Song of Ice and Fire"** by George R.R. Martin. In this case study, **we will analyze the co-occurrence network of the characters in the Game of Thrones books.**

The dataset is publicly available for the 5 books.

**Note: Here, two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books**.

-------------------------
## **Objectives:**
-------------------------
- Load all the raw datasets and perform descriptive analysis
- Run Network Analysis Algorithms on individual books (and combined)
- Calculate the different centralities measures and provide inference
- Create Network Graphs using Plotly
- Run Louvain Community Detection and find out different groups/communities in the data
